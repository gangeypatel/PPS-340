# Project 1

Basic Lexical Analysis project
You will extend the provided lexical analyzer to support more token types. 
The next section lists all new token types that you need to implement.

Follow these steps:

Download the  lexer.cc ,  lexer.h ,  inputbuf.cc   and  inputbuf.h  files accompanying this project description.
Add your code to the files to support the token types listed in the  previous section.

Compile your code using GCC compiler in Ubuntu 19.04 or higher.  22.04 is the latest version and you can use that version also. You will need to use the  g++  command to compile your code in a terminal window.

Note that you are required to compile and test your code in Ubuntu 19.04 or higher using the GCC compilers.

run test.sh for all test cases.


# Project 2

Project to generate FIRST and FOLLOW sets.

Same instructions as project

Run all test cases using test_p3.sh


# Project 3

The goal of this project is to implement a small compiler. 

compiler to compile IF ELSE, SWITCH, FOR, INPUT, OUTPUT, WHILE.

Instead, you will generate an intermediate representation (a data structure that represents the program).

The execution of the program will be done after compilation by interpreting the generated intermediate representation.

Same instructions as project 1 and 2.

Run all test cases using test_p3.sh
